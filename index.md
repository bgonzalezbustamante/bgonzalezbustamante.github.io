I am a Probationer Research Student (PRS) in the DPhil in Politics programme in the Department of Politics and International Relations and St Hildaâ€™s College at the University of Oxford, United Kingdom. Furthermore, I am an Instructor in the Department of Public Administration and Policy at the Faculty of Economics and Management at the Universidad de Santiago, where I have been working since 2014.

Before starting the DPhil, I earned a BA (2:1) in Government and an MA (1st) in Political Science, both from the Universidad de Chile. Moreover, I worked as a lecturer at the Universidad de Santiago and the Universidad de Chile, as well as a consultant for the United Nations Development Programme.
