I am a Probationer Research Student (PRS) in the DPhil in Politics programme in the Department of Politics and International Relations and St Hilda’s College at the University of Oxford, United Kingdom. Furthermore, I am an Instructor in the Department of Public Administration and Policy at the Faculty of Economics and Management at the Universidad de Santiago, where I have been working since 2014.

Before starting the DPhil, I earned a BA (2:1) in Government and an MA (1st) in Political Science, both from the Universidad de Chile. Moreover, I worked as a lecturer at the Universidad de Santiago and the Universidad de Chile, as well as a consultant for the United Nations Development Programme.

My doctoral research is supervised by Professor Petra Schleiter at St Hilda’s College and focuses on the stability of cabinets in Latin American presidential democracies. My research is supported by the Chilean National Agency for Research and Development. Additionally, I am interested in the political elite’s socialisation, civil services, political participation, digital media, online social networks, as well as electronic and open government.
